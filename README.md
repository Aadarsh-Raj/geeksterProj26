The moto of this project is for responsive web page. <br>
It is created using media query, in which the size of the image and the flex-direction of the main container have been fixed for small screen size. <br>
In max-screen size the flex direction is set to row-wise. <br>
In min-screen size the flex direction is set to column-wise. <br>
There is a header with white strip and the image is set to overlay on the header. <br>
Position: relative, and top: , have been used for fixing the some part of the image to the header. <br>
